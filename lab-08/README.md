## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer selects one signal from multiple signals. A multiplexer is sort of like a traffic intersection, since one "signal" (lane of traffic) is "selected" at a time.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer routes an input signal to one of several output channels. In the assignment description, a demultiplexer is likened to an AC selector. The selector routes the "signal" (a stream of air) to one "output channel" (one of the vents).

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
A mutliplexer could be used in one of the AV panels present in classrooms at the university. The AV panel can select between inputs (a desktop computer, laptop, or othe video source) and display it on a projector screen.

A demultiplexer is sort of like an internet router, like the example from the project. The router takes an input signal (a packet) and routes it to one of several different devices on a network.
