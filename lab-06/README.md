## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
You would be able to add more than two bit together by adding more adders into the circuit and wiring the carry out from the original circuit to the new adders.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The XOR gate is the sum of the addition of two bits in an adder circuit.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number that can be input into a two bit adder is 3. If the sum of the addition is greater than 3, then the carry out will be 1.
